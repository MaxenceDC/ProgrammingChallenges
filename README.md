# Programming Challenges v4.0

![Image showing all the 145 challenges](Images/challenges.png)   

This is my take on all the challenges of this image I found browsing the Internet. It seemed really interesting for me to try and beat some challenges and I decided to create this repo to write some code for those challenges. I will be solving those challenges in no pre-defined order, with the languages I think fit the most for me.

Here is my progress so far (tip: you can sort this list using *[Github sort content](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/wiki/GitHub-sort-content)*) :
